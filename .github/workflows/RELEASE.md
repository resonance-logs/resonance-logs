# Installation Instructions

# Instructions
- Most of what you need is in the Taskbar's System Tray notification icon (e.g. when you enable "Clickthrough", you can disable it here by right-clicking the icon)
    - When you "exit" the app, it hides it in there, doesn't close it
- Left click on player to see skill breakdown (right click to exit back to party)
- Left click on player name to copy #UID for easier searching
- The app auto-updates on launch (I plan to make a UI soonTM)
- The way the game detects players' information is when they "appear/disappear" from your view
